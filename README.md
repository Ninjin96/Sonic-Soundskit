# Sonic-Soundskit

Hi there everyone and future me reading this! welcome to yet again a new frontend project I've created. This time around I've worked with especially more Javascript and DOM manipulation rather than just HTML and CSS.

## Preview:

As usual for my frontend projects, they are hosted on GitHub: https://ninjin96.github.io/Sonic-Soundskit/.

Alternatively, you can download the code and open the HTML file.

## What does it do?
The functionality of this web page is pretty straightforward. You can click on one of the boxes displayed on the web page to hear a specific sound from the classic video game Sonic The Hedgehog. Additionally, you can hear the sounds by pressing on one of the keys on your keyboards that correspond with the letters displayed in the boxes.

Try it out!

Thanks again for checking out my project and take care!

## Extra Information
In this project I have used programming concepts like for loops and a switch case statement in a Web Development environment with JavaScript. Of course, this could've been written much simpler using a library like jQuery. But the aim of this project is to showcase the understanding of these programming concepts rather than to impress people with short and sweet code!
